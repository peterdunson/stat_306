Sample Space Worksheet #6 (3 ways!) +
Sec 2.8 Exercises # 3cd, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, 19, Optional Extra Credit Exercise #4


### Sample Space Worksheet #6

An organization has n members, two members are chosen at random to serve on maintenance board. Mr. and Mrs. Smith are both members of this organization, what is the probability that at least one of the smiths is chosen to serve.

a. Inclusion-Exclusion

Take A to be the event in which Mr. is chosen and B Mrs. \\

We want to find $P(A \cup B)$, or $P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$. \\

We have $\binom{n}{2}$ total ways to choose the board. There are $n-1$ ways to choose 2, INCLUDING Mr. Smith (n ways, but n-1 having already chosen Mr Smith). \\

So we have $P(A) = P(B) = \frac{n-1}{\binom{n}{2}}$, this simplifies to $\frac{2}{n}$. \\

And $P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}$. \\

If we solve for $P(A \cup B)$ using $P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$ we simplify to end up with $\frac{4n-6}{n(n-1)}$. \\

So $P(\text{at least one}) = \frac{4n-6}{n(n-1)}$. \\


b. Law of Equally Likely Outcomes 

Similar to above, there are $\binom{n}{2}$ total ways to choose 2 people.  \\

There is $1$ way to choose both Smiths and $\binom{2}{1} \cdot (n-2)$ ways to choose one or the other. \\

So $P(\text{at least one}) = \frac{2(n-2)}{\binom{n}{2}}$ which simplifies to $\frac{4n-6}{n(n-1)}$. \\


c. Third Method (use complements)

For the third method we look at P(No smiths). \\

$P(\text{no smiths}) = \frac{\binom{n-2}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}}$ \\

So $P(\text{At least one Smith}) = 1 - P(\text{no smiths}) = 1 - \frac{\binom{n-2}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}}$. \\

And this, of course, simplifies to $\frac{4n-6}{n(n-1)}$. 


### 3cd. 

c. 

There are $6$ possible ways for all 3 dice to be the same, one for each side of the dice.

There are $6^3$ total outcomes, so we have $P(\text{all three same}) = \frac{6}{6^3} = \frac{1}{36}$.


d.

Lets thing about possibilities here for sums of 10. \\

We have any permutation of:\\

1,3,6\\
1,4,5\\
2,2,6\\
2,4,4\\
2,3,5\\
3,3,4\\

If we look at the individual cases and sum the permutations we get: \\

$P(\sum 10) = \frac{3! \cdot 3! \cdot \frac{3!}{2!} \cdot \frac{3!}{2!} \cdot 3! \cdot \frac{3!}{2!}}{216} = \frac{1}{8}$. \\

Since we have 216 total outcomes and we account for each permutation for each outcome that sums to 10.


### 5.

A box contains 5 balls – 2 are white, 2 are black, and one is green. You choose two balls out of the box at random without replacement.

a. 

IF BALLS OF THE SAME COLOR ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE. (If not, there would be several more)

(W, W), (W, B), (W, G)

(B, B), (B, W), (B, G)

(G, W), (G, B)

b. 

We take $\frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{4}$, since there are 2 whites out of 5 originally, but after 1 is chosen, there is only 1 out of 4 remaining. \\

$P(\text{both white}) = \frac{1}{10}$


c.

This is just double the probability of both white, since $P(\text{both white}) = P(\text{both black})$ \\

So $P(\text{same color}) = \frac{1}{5}$


d. 

We can look at this problem by counting the outcomes where this happens.

We could have (W,W), (B, W), (G, W).

$P(W,W) = \frac{1}{10}$

$P(B,W) = \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{4} = \frac{2}{10}$

$P(G,W) = \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{10}$

So $P(\text{white second}) = \frac{2}{5}$.




### 7. 

Suppose you choose three numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} without replacement. \\

I assume order doesn't matter. \\

a.

$\binom{8}{3} = 56$

b.

$P(\text{2 even} = \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{1} = \frac{24}{56}$

c.

Well, we could either have (1,2,7) or (1,3,6) or (1,4,5) or (2,3,5). There are 56 possible choices so: \\


$P(\text{sum 10}) = \frac{4}{56}$





### 10.

In a lottery game, you make a random guess at the winning three-digit number (each digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). You win \$200 if your guess matches the winning number, \$20 if your guess matches in exactly two positions and \$2 if your guess matches in exactly one position. Find the probabilities of winning \$200, winning \$20, and winning \$2. \\


200.

There's exactly 1 right choice of the 1000 possible numbers. \\

$P(\$200) = \frac{1}{1000}$


20. 

We choose which digits are correct, then the remaining digit has to be wrong so there are 9 choices for that. \\

$P(\$20) = \frac{\binom{3}{2} \cdot 9}{1000} = \frac{27}{1000}$ 

2. 

We choose which digit is correct, then there are $9^2$ possibilities for the remaining two spots.

$P(\$2) = \frac{\binom{3}{2} \cdot 9 \cdot 9}{1000} = \frac{243}{1000}$


### 13.

You randomly mix up the letters “s”, “t”, “a”, “t”, “s”.

Find the probability the arrangement spells the word “stats”.
Find the probability the arrangement starts and ends with “s”.

a. 

$P(\text{stats}) = \frac{5!}{2!2!} = \frac{1}{30}$


b. 

$P(\text{starts and ends with s}) = $
