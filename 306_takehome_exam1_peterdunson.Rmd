## Problem 1

1. On the kitchen counter, a cookie jar initially contained three Oreo
cookies and five sugar cookies (almost white in color). When someone pulls
out an Oreo cookie, there is always that characteristic residue of fine black
crumbs left on the counter. Initially the counter is completely clean, but after
the five-year-old son of the family reaches in and pulls out three cookies at
random, one at a time, his mom notices the tell-tale scatter of black crumbs
on the counter. Given this forensic evidence, find


**Hypergeometric**

### [a] the conditional probability that the boy drew exactly two Oreos in his sample of three cookies. Show your calculations. [12]

3 oreo cookies, 5 sugar cookies \

At least 1 of 3 pulled is oreo. \

Total number of ways to pull 3 cookies from 8 is $\binom{8}{3} = 56$. \

$$
P(X=k): \\

P(X=0) = \frac{\binom{3}{0} \cdot \binom{5}{3}}{56} = \frac{10}{56} \\
P(X=1) = \frac{\binom{3}{1} \cdot \binom{5}{2}}{56} = \frac{30}{56} \\
P(X=2) = \frac{\binom{3}{2} \cdot \binom{5}{1}}{56} = \frac{15}{56} \\
P(X=3) = \frac{\binom{3}{3} \cdot \binom{5}{0}}{56} = \frac{1}{56} \\

$$

$P(X=2 \mid X \geq 1) = \frac{P(X=2, X \geq 1)}{P(X \geq 1)}$

Given our pmf above, $P(X=2, X \geq 1) = \frac{15}{56}$ and $P(X>=1) = \frac{46}{56}$, so:

$$
P(X=2 \mid X \geq 1) = \frac{15}{46} = 0.32608695652
$$


### [b] the conditional probability that the boy’s third cookie drawn was a sugar cookie. Show your calculations. [12]


Total outcomes where $X \geq 1 = 30 + 15 + 1 = 46$. \

Let $S_3$ be the event that the 3rd cookie is Sugar. We need $P(S_3 \mid X \geq 1)$. \

Total number of Sugar cookies across all $X \geq 1$ cases: \

$X=1$ (2 Sugar): $30 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot 3 = 60$ sugar cookies \
$X=2$ (1 Sugar): $15 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot 3 = 15$ sugar cookies \
$X=3$ (0 Sugar): $0$ sugar cookies \

Total sugar cookies in our reduced sample space = $60 + 15 + 0 = 75$. \

Since each of the 3 positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd) is equally likely to hold any of the cookies in the sample: \

$$
P(S_3 \mid X \geq 1) = P(S_3 \mid X \geq 1) = \frac{\sum S_i}{n \cdot (\text{Valid Outcomes})} \\

P(S_3 \mid X \geq 1) = \frac{75}{46 \cdot 3} = \frac{75}{138} \\

P(S_3 \mid X \geq 1) = \frac{25}{46} = 0.54347826087

$$




### [c] the expectation of the number of Oreos eaten by the boy. [10] \


We need the conditional expectation $E[X \mid X \geq 1]$. \

$P(X=k \mid X \geq 1) = \frac{P(X=k)}{P(X \geq 1)}$: \

$P(X=1 \mid X \geq 1) = \frac{30/56}{46/56} = \frac{30}{46}$ \
$P(X=2 \mid X \geq 1) = \frac{15/56}{46/56} = \frac{15}{46}$ \
$P(X=3 \mid X \geq 1) = \frac{1/56}{46/56} = \frac{1}{46}$ \

So, the expectation is the weighted sum of these outcomes: \

$$
E[X \mid X \geq 1] = \sum_{k=1}^{3} k \cdot P(X=k \mid X \geq 1) \\

E[X \mid X \geq 1] = \left(1 \cdot \frac{30}{46}\right) + \left(2 \cdot \frac{15}{46}\right) + \left(3 \cdot \frac{1}{46}\right) \\

E[X \mid X \geq 1] = \frac{30 + 30 + 3}{46} = \frac{63}{46} \\

E[X \mid X \geq 1] = 1.36956521739
$$

## Problem 2

2. A player rolls a fair die. If it is not a six, then the player’s turn is over
and his score is the value showing on the die. However, if the die value is six,
he gets to roll one more time as a bonus! The player’s score X is then the
sum of his two rolls. For example, consider the following die sequences, and
the subsequent score for that player’s turn.

rolls : (6,1) score X = 7
rolls : (6,6) score X = 12
rolls : (4) score X = 4
rolls : (3) score X = 3


### [a] Find the probability mass function for X (a table will suffice). Please don’t simplify probability fractions — keep them with the same denominator so they’re easy to compare. [10]



### [b] Verify that your probabilities in [a] sum to an appropriate value. [8]



### [c] Find the expectation and variance for X. [16]



### [d] If we know that the player’s score is at least 4, then find the conditional probability that she got a bonus roll. [8]

## Problem 3

3. Sometimes when it is desired to get survey data on a sensitive issue,
for example whether or not students have ever cheated on an exam, the
following method is employed. The question is “Have you ever cheated on
an exam?”, and the student answering the question flips a fair coin — if
the coin lands heads the student answers “Yes” regardless of the truth, and
if the coin lands tails, the student answers truthfully. Then a Yes answer
is diluted by a plethora of false positives, giving security to a student that
answers Yes genuinely. This survey sampling strategy is actually very useful
in getting data on sensitive issues by backing out the false positives — so
clever! Suppose in a very large student population, a proportion p of the
students have cheated on an exam in their past.


### [a] If a student is chosen at random from this population, and takes the survey by flipping the coin, and answering accordingly, then what is the probability the student answers Yes? [10]


### [b] Suppose five students from this population are my advisees, and upon taking the coin-flip survey, all five answer Yes. Given this information, what is the probability that at least one of my advisees has cheated on an exam? Your answer will of course be a function of p. [16]

## Problem 4

4. There are two boxes on stage. Box B contains 10 blue balls, and
the other, Box W, contains 6 white balls. A common fair die is rolled by the
game-master and if the roll of the die is x, then xblue balls are removed from
Box B and these x blue balls are placed in Box W. Finally, after stirring, a
ball is drawn at random from Box W.


### [a] Find the probability that the final ball drawn from Box W is blue. [10]


### [b] Find the conditional distribution of the die roll given that the final ball drawn from Box W is blue. [16]


### [c] Compare and contrast the conditional distribution of die rolls in [b] with the distribution of the die rolls before we learned that the ball from Box W was blue. [8]

## Problem 5

5. The probability p that an old component of robotic machinery success-
fully attaches two engine parts is modeled by the prior distribution
π(p) = 2p , 0 <p<1.
The variable of interest in a factory experiment is X = the number of
attempts required until the robot successfully attaches the two parts, and
you may assume that attempts are independent, and each has probably of
success p.


### a] For starters, show that π(p) is a valid prior distribution. [6]



### b] Find the joint distribution for the random variables p and X. [10]



### c] Find the marginal distribution for the random variable X. In other words, find a formula for P(X= x) for x= 1,2,3,.... [12]



### d] Find the posterior distribution for pgiven that X= xis observed in the experiment. [10]



### e] In Bayesian inference, often the mean (or expectation) of the posterior distribution is used as an estimate of p based on the evidence — for this experiment, find this posterior mean as a function of the observed data x. [8]

##Problem 6

6. Let Ω be the region defined by:
Ω = {(x,y) : 0 <x<2, 0 <y< x/2}
I recommend you graph the region Ω.
Suppose (X,Y) are jointly continuous random variables distributed on Ω with
joint density

f(x,y) = (1/3)(y+ 2x), (x,y) ∈ Ω,

and f(x,y) = 0 otherwise.


### [a] Verify that f(x,y) is a valid density function. [10]


### [b] Find the marginal density for X. [8]


### [c] Find the marginal density for Y. [10]


### [d] Find the conditional density of Y given X. [8]


### [e] Find the expectation of Y given that X= x. [10]


### [f] If we know that X = 1, find the probability that Y is in the interval (1/4, 1/2). [10]
