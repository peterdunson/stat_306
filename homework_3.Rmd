Sec 3.8 Exercises # 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 17, 18, 23, 28, 30, Optional Extra Credit King's Gold and Silver Chest Problem

** for problems 5 and 8, find the requested probabilities using the classical view of probability in addition to the frequency view


### Problem 5

Classical

a.

There are $\binom{9}{3}$ total ways of choosing 3 balls.

$P(F_1) = \frac{\binom{4}{1} \cdot \binom{5}{2}}{\binom{9}{3}}$

$P(B_1) = \frac{\binom{3}{1} \cdot \binom{6}{2}}{\binom{9}{3}}$

b.

c.

d.


Frequency

a. 

$P(F_1) = \frac{416}{1000} = 0.416$

$P(B_1) = \frac{444}{1000} = 0.444$

b. 

$P(F_1 | B_1) = \frac{198}{444} = 0.4459459$

c. 

$P(B_1 | F_1) = \frac{198}{416} = 0.4759615$

d.

If $F_1$ and $B_1$ are independent, then $P(B_1) \cdot P(F_1) = P(B_1 \cap F_1)$.

But, $0.416 * 0.444 = 0.184704 \neq P(B_1 \cap F_1) = 0.198$
